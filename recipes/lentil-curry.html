  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon cocounut oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon each: cumin seeds and coriander seeds</li>
    <li>1 head garlic, <em>chopped (10-12 cloves)</em></li>
    <li>28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ginger, <em>chopped</em></li>
    <li>1 tablespoon turmeric</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
    <li>1 cup dried brown lentils</li>
    <li>1-2 teaspoons cayenne powder, <em>optional</em></li>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>15 ounce can coconut milk</li>
    <li>A few handfuls of cherry tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped cilantro</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the coconut oil in a large pot or skillet over <strong>medium-high heat</strong>. Add the cumin and coriander seeds and toast until they start to brown, about <strong>45 seconds</strong>. Add the garlic to the pot and let it brown, about <strong>2 minutes</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add the can of crushed tomatoes, ginger, turmeric, and sea salt to the pot and cook, stirring the pot a few times, for <strong>5 minutes</strong>. Add the lentils and, if using, the cayenne powder, and the water to the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for <strong>35-40 minutes</strong>, or until the lentils are soft. Stir the pot a few times to prevent the lentils from sticking to the bottom. If the curry starts to look dry, add an extra Â½ - 1 cup of water.</li>
    <li>Once the lentils are soft and the curry is thick, add the coconut milk and cherry tomatoes and bring the pot back to a simmer. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cilantro. Pair with basmati rice.</li>
