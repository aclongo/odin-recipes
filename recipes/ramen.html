  <h2>Description</h2>
  <div class="description"><p>Packaged ramen was a comfort food for me growing up, but this is world's beyond that!</p>
  <p>"Put down that cup of instant noodles. Seriously. Why settle for mediocre when you have the real deal... from
    scratch? Fine, there is an extra 15-20 minutes (gasp) that will go to preparing the real deal, but in my books that
    is the definition of quick and easy. The extra (small) time investment is soo worth the result. Freshly made, quick
    and easy vegetarian ramen is packed with fresh vegetables, noodles, and authentic flavours, and it's ready in just
    15 minutes."</p></div>
