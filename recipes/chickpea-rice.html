  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is one of my favorite "staple" recipes. The ingredients last for a long time and tend to be things you already
    have on hand (<em>especially</em> if you do ground parmesan and dried parsley). It's easy to put together and
    absolutely delicious. I would recommend measuring out the basil, oregano, salt and pepper ahead of
    time into a small bowl while the chickpeas are cooking in step 3.</p>
  <p>I originally got this recipe from <a href="https://www.food.com/recipe/chickpeas-and-rice-195593">Food.com</a> but
    since added the kalamata olives and the option to replace the parmesan with feta for more of a Mediterranean feel,
    if you have them on hand!</p>
