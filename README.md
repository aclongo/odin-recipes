# odin-recipes
My Recipes project for the Odin Project Foundations course
Welcome to my first project! I aim to demonstrate the HTML skills I've gained so far on this journey, including the
    use of headings, paragraphs, text elements, lists, absolute and relative links, and images.
The three recipes I chose are:
    -Mediterranean Chickpeas and Rice
    -Creamy Coconut Lentil Curry
    -Veggie Ramen
